```

### 2. Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here

## ü§î Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Redux Toolkit** was chosen for easy slice setup and state tracking with devtools.
- **Two-step selection (`selected` vs `applied`)** gives better UX and control over chart rendering.
- **Mixed Tailwind and styled-components**: Utility-first classes for quick layout, styled-components for reusable panels and buttons.
- **Static data** is used instead of fetching from an API to stay within the scope.
- **Custom hover delay** for "CO‚ÇÇ Distribution" shows how variable-specific behaviors can be added.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- State resets on refresh ‚Äì no persistence layer is implemented.
- No dynamic chart color variations or legends.
- OAuth only supports Google provider.
- No formal accessibility testing yet.
